    <p>When visiting Dubai, it is essential that you are aware of the visa requirements to enter the country as a
        Canadian citizen.
        Furthermore, traveling to a new country means that you are exposed to a completely different environment,
        such as the weather, culture, people, etc. This will be a checklist of all requirements before visiting Dubai.
    </p>


    <h4 id="section1"><u>Visa Requirements</u></h4>

    <p>If you are a Canadian citizen wishing to visit the United Arab Emirates for tourism,
        you are not required to obtain a tourist visa. Instead, you will be given a stamp
        upon entry to the United Arab Emirates, which is valid for 30 days. An extension can be requested for an
        additional 30 days.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section2"><u>Passport Requirements</u></h4>

    <p>It is important to note that you must use the same passport used when entering the U.A.E when exiting the
        country as well. If a new passport is issued during your stay, then you must contact immigration to make
        sure that the visa has been transferred.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section3"><u>Traveling from Toronto to Dubai</u></h4>

    <p>Traveling to Dubai is no short trip. As a direct flight from Toronto takes around 13-14 hours,
        it is essential for you to be prepared for a long flight and bring all necessary toiletries for the journey.
        It is also important to note that Dubai has very strict drug laws. Therefore, it is advisable to check
        beforehand
        if any drugs you are carrying are legal, as over-the-counter drugs in Canada may not be permissible in the
        U.A.E.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section4"><u>Weather</u></h4>

    <p>When traveling to the U.A.E, it can be assumed that you are wishing to enjoy the nice weather; however,
        the temperature in Dubai specifically can vary greatly depending on the seasons. During the summer season,
        the average temperature is around 40-45 degrees Celsius, which is extremely hot and travelers can be at risk
        of heat stroke. The weather in both spring and autumn averages above 35 degrees Celsius, which is still very
        hot.
        Hence, the recommended time to visit would be in the winter months when the average temperature is around 25-30
        degrees
        Celsius, which is a much more comfortable temperature to be in when you are out exploring the city.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section5"><u>Mindfulness of Culture</u></h4>

    <p>When visiting Dubai, it is important to be aware of what is socially acceptable, as it differs from Canada.
        Some actions are deemed unacceptable or disrespectful, including public displays of affection such as kissing
        and petting, which can lead to arrest. Swearing and fighting in public are also considered disrespectful and
        are against the law. Additionally, being intoxicated in public spaces is forbidden, so it is important to be
        aware of this and to take a taxi straight home after a night out.

    </p>

    <h4 id="section6"><u>Transportation in Dubai</u></h4>

    <p>For transportation in the city, there are several options. Firstly, you could rent a car, and in Dubai,
        whether you want a Toyota or a Lamborghini, there are many cars available for rental during your stay.
        If you don’t wish to rent a car, the most popular transportation app is known as Careem, which is
        equivalent to Uber in Canada and is a great and quick way to get around town. Dubai also offers an
        incredibly efficient way of transport, which is the Dubai metro, which is very quick and inexpensive.
    </p>

    <h4 id="section7"><u>Arabic Words and Phrases to Speak with the Locals</u></h4>

        <li>Sabah al-khair: Good morning (صباح الخير) </li>
