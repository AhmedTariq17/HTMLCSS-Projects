    <h4>Let's EAT!</h4>
    <p>If you love food, Dubai is the place to go. You are offered an abundance of cuisine made with the highest quality
        ingredients,
        including fine dining and fast food places which produce much higher quality products.

    <h4 id="section1"><u>Al-Baik</u></h4>
    <img src="AB.jpeg" alt="Al-Baik picture" height="400" width=750 />

    <p>Al-Baik is an extremely popular fast-food restaurant in Dubai, known for its fried chicken.
        It is located inside the Dubai Mall, and sometimes people have to wait in line for a couple of hours before
        getting their food.
        People in the Gulf region swear that it is the best fried chicken in the world. The restaurant originated in
        Saudi Arabia
        and was only available there until the first location was opened in Dubai. For those who have lived or visited
        Saudi Arabia,
        everyone always recommends trying Al-Baik as it is also very nostalgic for many expats who may have left Saudi
        Arabia.
        The restaurant being in Dubai, which is a travel hub for the world, gives many people the opportunity to go out
        on a
        layover and try one of the most popular fried chicken places in the world.

    <p>CZN Burak is a Turkish fine dining restaurant whose owner you most likely have seen while scrolling on social
        media.
        The owner and chef at the restaurant, Burak Özdemir, is a famous media personality, as he has posted videos of
        himself
        creating ginormous foods with a big smile on his face, and these videos have amassed millions of views online.
        The popularity of his videos matches that of his restaurant, and for good reason, as delicious Turkish meats,
        desserts,
        and cocktails are served and enjoyed by everyone who dines there.

    <p>Ristorante L’Olivo at Al Mahara is a seafood Italian restaurant located in the Palm Jumeirah at the famous Burj
        Al Arab hotel.
        It is a Michelin-starred restaurant which has recently been introduced to Dubai. However, the reviews for this
        place have been incredible. People who have dined here have expressed their love for the ambiance and atmosphere
        of the restaurant and are delighted with the food made by Chef Andrea Migliaccio. One of the big drawing points
        of this restaurant is the aquarium view that you get when eating, as it is described to emmulate the feeling
        about being at
        the waters of Capri, Italy.

    <p>Nobu is a well-recognized restaurant name, synonymous with serving the most flavorful food made of exotic and
        expensive
        ingredients. With restaurants located around the world, including famous cities such as New York, Los Angeles,
        and London,
        Nobu has become a household name. They are most famous for their miso black cod, which is cod marinated in miso
        for three
        days, bringing out a wonderful flavor that must be tried. Although this restaurant is not exclusive to Dubai,
        there are
        still reasons to visit. Nobu Dubai incorporates Middle Eastern flavoring, offering a unique taste to their food
        that sets
        it apart from other Nobu locations, making it a must-visit place when in Dubai.
