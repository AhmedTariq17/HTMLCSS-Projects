        </h3>
    </header>

    <p>We are a travel agency that has partnered with the government of the United Arab Emirates to showcase to
        Canadians
        the wonderful city of Dubai. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive guide for Canadians when visiting
        Dubai,
        including the dos and don'ts of traveling to a new country. We have been highly successful in achieving our
        mission
        and are excited to expand our services to people all over the world, introducing them to the city of the future
        - Dubai.

        We firmly believe that Dubai is a top-tier city in every aspect, from low crime rates to the happiness of its
        people.
        Our job is to showcase how this oasis has been built from the ground up to not only be a great place for tourism
        but
        also an excellent place to live.
