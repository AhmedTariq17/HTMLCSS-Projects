    <h4 id="section1"><u>The Oasis That is Dubai</u></h4>
    <p>Dubai is a city that never ceases to amaze with its endless array of activities and attractions.
        Known as the city of the future, Dubai is a place where you'll never be bored thanks to the sheer volume of
        things to see and do. Whether you're interested in exploring the marvels of modern architecture or seeking
        adventure,
        Dubai has something for everyone. At every turn, you'll encounter a world record feat, from the world's tallest
        building
        to the largest mall. With such impressive sights and experiences on offer, Dubai is a must-visit destination for
        anyone
        seeking a taste of the extraordinary.
    </p>


    <h4 id="section2"><u>Burj Khalifa</u></h4>

    <p>For starters, one site of the city which cannot truly be missed, and is a must-visit place,
        is the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. This freestanding structure is the biggest
        ever in history to be created by man, standing at an astounding 828 meters tall, which is almost
        a kilometer in height. The Burj Khalifa can be seen throughout the city; however, being up close
        with the building is a unique experience in itself, especially at night where the building is projecting
        with sparkles lighting up the skyline. Although the view from the outside is incredible, the Burj Khalifa
        offers a lot from the inside as well, having the world's highest observation deck which overlooks the
        whole horizon, and the entire city of Dubai can be viewed from it. Tours of the building are accessible;
        yet, if you want a more special experience, you can do activities in the Burj such as gaining access to the
        luxurious Armani spa to unwind and relax during your trip to the city. After visiting the spa, you may feel a
        bit hungry, so you can help yourself by visiting the world's highest restaurant called Altitude. Overall, the
        Burj Khalifa is a must-visit when coming to Dubai, and the experience will be remembered for a lifetime.

    <h4 id="section3"><u>Dubai Mall</u></h4>

    </figure>

    <p>Being in the most opulent city in the world, you must be wondering if Dubai has any good malls. 
        The answer to that is yes, Dubai is home to the best and biggest mall in the entire world, the Dubai Mall. 
        Nothing about this mall is similar to that of your local mall, as everything in the Dubai Mall screams 
        flamboyance and extravagance. The Dubai Mall contains over 1,200 stores, containing any luxury brand imaginable, 
        and 200 restaurants, which showcase food from around the world, reflecting the diversity of people who live in the city. 
        The mall is also home to formerly the world's biggest aquarium, located right in the middle of the mall, where people 
        can walk through and be up close and surrounded by beautiful marine wildlife. The mall also has attractions for everyone, 
        such as a cinema, a haunted house, an opera, and a trampoline park, just to name a few.

    <h4 id=" section4"><u>Palm Jumeirah</u></h4>

    <p>The leadership of the United Arab Emirates are visionaries, and their creativity is expressed through 
        the wonderful city of Dubai. Their ambition to make Dubai a unique city, separate from the rest of the world, 
        can be best exemplified through the creation of the Palm Jumeirah. This man-made island, shaped like a palm tree, 
        is the largest man-made island in the world and is truly breathtaking when observed from a bird's eye view. 
        This island is home to many magnificent hotels and homes for Dubai residents, but it is also a place riddled 
        with fun activities. One of the world's only 7-star hotels, Atlantis, is located on the Palm, and you can gain 
        access to its world-famous water park. The water park, just like the other places mentioned in this list, is one 
        of the largest waterparks in the world and is a great destination for families, as it is a wonderland for children. 
        Skydiving is an extreme sport and can be done all around the world; however, the skydiving experience on the Palm is
        unlike any other, as when you are coming down, you have a magical bird's eye view of the Palm alongside the crystal 
        clear waters surrounding Dubai. If you are not interested in such extreme activities, the Palm also has more calming 
        exercises, such as taking a paddleboat in the waters with your friends, overlooking the scenery of what the Palm has
        to offer.
    </p>

    <h4 id=" section5"><u>Burj Al Arab</u></h4>

    <p>

        Last but not least, Dubai is home to the world's first-ever 7-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab. 
        This hotel is the epitome of luxury, as only the finest materials such as Statuario marble, gold leaf, and lighting 
        fixtures made out of Swarovski crystals, were used in the construction of the hotel. Upon walking into the hotel, 
        you are greeted with world-renowned staff giving you the best customer service experience of your life. Although the 
        glitz and glamour of this establishment can possibly be slightly overwhelming, there is history and significance to 
        this hotel as well. The infamous helipad located just above three-quarters of the building has had many cool things 
        happen on it. Red Bull, in specific, have done many stunts such as doing donuts in a Formula One car on the helipad 
        celebrating a grand prix win. Most recently, they had landed a plane as well as taken off from the helipad. 
        All of these things combined make the Burj Al Arab a must-see when visiting Dubai.
